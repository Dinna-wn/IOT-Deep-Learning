# IOT-Deep-Learning

Our system is an ECG monitoring based on Internet-of-Things (IoT) , where ECG data are gathered using portable monitoring device and transmitted directly to computer for feature extraction and classification. 

Part one:

• Build an integrated IoT system .

• Collect real-time data of ECG .


Part two:

• Extract features from the obtained ECG signals.

• Detect abnormality in ECG signals using CNN pre-trained model.

• Display the result of the prediction.



The classification accuracy of 98.50% is achieved with the proposed pre-trained model ALEXNET when tested on the publicly available Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) arrhythmia database.
